How to use this template
========================

1. Create new repository from template
2. Add repository secrets `AOC_SESSION` and `AOC_USER_ID`
3. Replace 20XX with correct year in README.md and workflow files

Every day during December, the `aoc-download-input.yml` workflow will
download the input files. Once all the input files for that year have
been downloaded, remove the trigger so that it doesn't run
unnecessarily.

Every time a dayXX.py file is added/modified, the `aoc-badges.yml`
workflow will update the badges in the Readme. Once you have all 50
stars, remove the trigger so that it doesn't run unnecessarily.
